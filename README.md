## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned 2 solutions with tailwind sematic to align flex items: 
- Use self-[end, center, start] to set flex item base on flex-axis.
- Use translate-[x or y]-[number] to move items to new position.

```html
<div class="... self-center">
<div class="... translate-y-12">
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Align flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This helps how to align flex items.
